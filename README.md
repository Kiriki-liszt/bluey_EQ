# easy box

500-style channel strip for vocal-podcasting.  

1. airwindows channel9 - fixed to neve.  
2. Lowcut filter <- might not be used, and not implemented yet.  
3. maag-liftikus eq, but I made it auto adjusted to sample rate and added a 1.2 kHz peak filter for mid-focus control.  
4. airwindows DeBess, fixed filter.  
5. MeowMu compressor. Variation of airwindows VariMu comp.  
6. airwindows gate, implemented but gui not made.  
7. REAPER version of sonnos Inflator, with fixed curve.  

Still developing, but you can try it in build folder.  

Windows only. No Mac nor Linux campatible.  

Built for VST3, but compatible to VST2 also.
